# Homework 2

*Prompt: Briefly describe what you did, how it went, and what is still to be done.*


## Setup

Since HW1 involved creating WAV files from scratch, I started this assignment by
writing some new code which was capable of reading pre-recorded WAV files from
disk. Once my code was able to successfully read, play, and write pre-existing
audio files, I was ready to start the real assignment: building the filter and
adjusting the bit rate.

## Filtering

For practice, I began by creating the "Simple FIR Lowpass Filter" as described 
in the `Digital Audio Filters -> FIR Filters` course page:

```python
y[i] = (x[i] + x[i-1]) / 2
```

After confirming that my simple filter worked, I went ahead and implemented a
'higher order filter' as explained the same course page and later described as:

```python
y[i] = Î£(j=0, N-1) a[j]x[i-j]
```

I used the same filter coefficients as the ones provided in the course github
at https://github.com/pdx-cs-sound/hw-resample. I follow the instructions in
the provided code in order to generate these coefficients at resampling time.

My second filter takes a long time to process the audio since it is has to loop
through all the coefficients for every index in the new sample. Although it was
fun to write everything by hand myself, in the future I would still like to
re-create this filter using the `scipy.signal.lfilter()` function mentioned in
the assignment handout. It would be fun to figure out and interesting to see
if it improves the speed of the filtering operation.



## Testing

I tested my program by generating lots of copies of the audio files provided in
the assignment. I listened to each copy to confirm that the half-rate file
sounded the same as the original (I couldn't really tell a difference even with 
the "simple" filter to be completely honest). I also inspected each new file in
Audacity to see how the waveforms looked and to confirm that everything was
working as intended.
