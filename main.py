#   the above didn't work so I tried installing a 'wheel' for my version of python here:

# The Assignment
#
#   1.  Build a program in your chosen language that writes a sine wave to a WAV file named sine.wav
#       in the current directory. Specifications for your sine wave:
#
#           Channels per frame: 1 (mono)
#           Sample size: 16 bits
#           Amplitude: ¼ maximum possible amplitude (-8192..8192)
#           Duration: one second
#           Frequency: 440Hz
#           Sample Rate: 48000 samples per second
#
#       Generate the samples yourself using your language's sin() function — if your language has no
#       math library, get a different language.
#
#   2.  Extend your program to also write a WAV file named clipped.wav in the current directory.
#       Generate a sine wave as though it were ½ maximum amplitude (-16384..16384), except: samples
#       that would be greater than ¼ maximum amplitude (8192) should instead be ¼ maximum amplitude;
#       samples that would be less than ¼ minimum amplitude (-8192) should instead be ¼ minimum
#       amplitude. Other than this change, all other parameters remain the same as in Part 1.
#
#       Your wave should look "clipped" like this in Audacity. Note the phase: the waveform starts
#       upward from zero.
#
#       Also check the sample rate, amplitude and frequency while you're in Audacity. On Linux the
#       file command will also tell you the frequency, number of channels, and bits per sample. Or
#       you can use the wavfile Python utility I built for the course. Lots of options.
#
#   3.  Extend your program to also play the same clipped sine wave on your computer's audio output.
#       Do not shell out to an external program for this: use an audio library.
#
#       Each time your program is run, it should do all three of these things.
#


# class for holding the specifications for the audio file
